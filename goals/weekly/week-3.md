# Week 3
[Makers weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)

## Goals for This Week

### 1. Build a simple web app

- During pair programming, my partners and I built a simple 'Battle' game app which ran in the browser. 
- For the weekend challenge, I built a functioning broswer-based game of rock paper scissors. 

### 2. Follow an effective debugging process for web applications

- I attended a debugging workshop and debugged a blog app. I used the stack trace to find several bugs in the code => [Debugging Blog App](https://github.com/hannahdesmond/skills-workshops/tree/master/how_the_web_works/debugging_blog_app)

### 3. Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS) 

- I carried out servers-1 and clients-1 practicals to understand how clients and servers talk to each other. 

### 4. Explain the MVC pattern 

- I researched MVC and shared resources with my pairs and my cohort. I explained the how the model, view and controller interact when pair programming on the Battle app.

#### Code Review

[Review of Fellow Learner's Challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/takeaway-challenge/pull/2125) 
I participated in a code review and felt that compared to when I have given code reviews before, I was able to give more useful feedback by running my partner's codes and tests locally and getting a better understanding of what their code did. I gave feedback on OOP principles (e.g. Single Responsibility Principle), the business logic of the code, and what their tests were testing.
