# Oystercard 
## Week 2 Pairing Challenge at Makers Academy

Create an Osytercard which can be topped up, stores journeys and adjusts balance. 

[Full Brief](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/oystercard) 

[Project](https://github.com/hannahdesmond/oyster-card) 

## Goals
These are the Makers goals which I made progress towards in this challenge:
- I can TDD anything
- I can program fluently
- I can debug anything
- I can refactor anything
- I have a methodical approach to solving problems

## Week 2 Goals

Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this) :white_check_mark:

Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage :white_check_mark:

Unit test classes in isolation using mocking :white_check_mark:

Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change) :white_check_mark:

## Feedback

### Ed George – Pair Parnter
**How did you feel at the start of the session? How did you feel at the end of the session?**
>Relaxed, satisfied + motivated

**What skill did I demonstrate well during the pairing session?**
>Empathy, logic. 

**What could I improve?**
>Not sure, to be fair I mainly led our session. Will look out for something next time

### Iain Aitken – Pair Parnter
**How did you feel at the start of the session? How did you feel at the end of the session?**
>Tired at the start! Better at the end, more relaxed, I thought it was a good pairing session.

**What skill did I demonstrate well during the pairing session?**
>You're very methodical when it comes to TDD, following the red, green, refactor process. You 're good at writing code, it's obvious you've learned a lot over the last two weeks.

**What could I improve?**
>I think probably reading error messages - be as methodical with those, following the trace through, as you are with writing code in the first place and that'll definitely be an improvement.

### Sandy Pounoussamy – Pair Parntner
**How did you feel at the start of the session? How did you feel at the end of the session?**
I feel good, ready to approach a new challenge. I was happy to have be able to test my understanding of Domain Modeling and RSpec.

**What skill did I demonstrate well during the pairing session?**
>Git collaboration, CLI, debugging basics


**What could I improve?**
>I think working on 'domain modeling' would help you get a clearer picture of what needs the user stories are describing and also just training with RSpec syntax (me as well)


### Jack Gumoes – Pair Parnter
**How did you feel at the start of the session? How did you feel at the end of the session?**
>I felt good all the way through

**What skill did I demonstrate well during the pairing session?**
>I felt you were willing to tackle new problems head-on

**What could I improve?**
