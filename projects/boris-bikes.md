# Boris Bikes 
## Week 1 Pairing Challenge at Makers Academy

London's Boris Bikes (well, 'Santander Cycles') are awesome. Anyone can hire out a bike and ride it around London.

Let's go back several years, to the days when there were no Boris Bikes. Imagine that you're a junior developer (that was easy). Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, come to you with a plan: a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want you to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.

## Feedback

### Adam Philips – Pair Parnter
**How did you feel at the start of the session? How did you feel at the end of the session?**
>Little nervous - never worked together before, and that was gone within miniutes - very easy going and fun to work with.

**What skill did I demonstrate well during the pairing session?**
>Provided useful tips and explanations on quicker ways to navigate around atom and command line. Explanations were not quick and you were very patient if i did not understand something

**What could I improve?**
>I got the impression that you thought it was a negative thing that you are slow to go through things, so maybe an improvement on sort of self confidence and knowing that it doesn't matter at what pace you are going through stuff as long as you learning every step of the way that's all that matters.

### Laura Keen – Pair Partner
**How did you feel at the start of the session? How did you feel at the end of the session?**
>I felt good at the start, ready to get into it but also a little nervous as I usually am at the start of the pairing session. By the end of the session I felt really relaxed and comfortable and felt like I had learnt a lot. I definitely felt a lot more confident about pairing as I realised that having a chat about what we need at the start of the session meant we could create a really non-judgemental environment!

**What skill did I demonstrate well during the pairing session?**
>I think you did a really good job of creating a good pairing environment - I really appreciated that you took all of my concerns that we spoke about at the start of the session into consideration throughout and created a really relaxed atmosphere where we could still be productive without feeling unnecessary pressure. You also were very good at explaining exactly what you were doing as you went along which was useful for both of us. I learnt from you that before just throwing any old code into the program that I should stop and explain to my partner why I am doing it and what I expect the code to do which is really valuable. 

**What could I improve?**
>I am genuinely struggling to think of any improvements that you could make other than maybe just have a bit more faith that you actually have built a really good foundation of knoweledge and as we discussed that other people aren't always in a rush - something I definitely need to work on too!

### Nico Bermejo – Pair Partner
**What skill did I demonstrate well during the pairing session?**
>Approached each problem with a fresh mind, not afraid to ask questions and pause if needed which allowed for clearer explanations for both you and myself.

**What could I improve?**
>I would suggest continuing to map out the steps required in a diagram to be able to get a clearer picture of the problem
