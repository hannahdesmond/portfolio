#### Code Review

[Review of Fellow Learner's Challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/takeaway-challenge/pull/2125) 
I participated in a code review and felt that compared to when I have given code reviews before, I was able to give more useful feedback by running my partner's codes and tests locally and getting a better understanding of what their code did. I gave feedback on OOP principles (e.g. Single Responsibility Principle), the business logic of the code, and what their tests were testing.
