# Week 4
[Makers weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)

## Goals for This Week

1. Build a simple web app with a database ✅
This week's challenge has been to build a bookmark manager web app to manage bookmarked sites. I have continued to use Sinatra, Ruby, RSpec and Capybara to build my model, view and controller, and added in PostgreSQL to create databases. This week's challenge has been very in-depth so I opted to focus solely on this for the week. 

2. Follow an effective debugging process for database applications ✅
I have used an effective debugging process both solo and with my pair partners on this week's challenge. 

3. Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships between tables) ✅
Working with my pair partners, we have discussed the structure of relational databases including tables, and used SQL to manipulate database data. I also watched a 90-minute Pluralsight course on PostgreSQL

#### Reflection

This week is the first week that I hadn't previously done in the February cohort, and I was very pleased with how I progressed and understood material that I wasn't familiar with. I feel like all of my pairing sessions went well this week. My debugging process has become more methodical and I was very happy to have been able to help my Thursday pair to debug something that she had been stuck on for a while before our session. 
After reaching the end of week 4, I am looking back at the overall course goals and considering which ones I would like to make more progress towards.
### **I can make software**

- I can TDD anything: I feel that I have a decent understanding of why we TDD, and many of my tests are solid. I know how to use RSpec and feel confident using Capybara. I generally follow the red-green-refactor cycle but I have noticed, once or twice, that I have missed part of a user requirement so have coded it only to remember that I hadn't tested first. So, this is something I would like to be more aware of. I also want to make sure I have multiple tests for each behaviour, as sometimes my tests may not defend against edge cases, or may not fully test what I want it to. For example, a test for registering a name should use more than one name in the test to ensure that there isn't a hard-coded value in the code. 
- I can program fluently: I continue to learn more about Ruby every day. In the evenings, I am working my way through *Practical Object-Oriented Design* (Metz) and I am growing in my understanding of how to program fluently. My processes are all improving.
- I can debug anything: My debugging is improving all the time. I am much better at reading the stack trace and being able to tighten the loop and get visibility on the problem. I also use the tools I have available to me – I use `p` statements to check that my values are what I think they are. I use `irb` to determine that my methods and classes are behaving in the way that I think they are. I have also been using the Chrome DevTools and TablePlus to help me get more visibility when I encounter bugs. I am also making sure I run RSPec regularly and make changes in small increments so that there is less opportunity for bugs to go undetected. 
- I can model anything – I have created some models so far throughout the course, but I am aware that I could improve my modelling skills. This week, I spent some time watching a workshop recording of CRC modelling. This is something that I can try to help me improve my design. 
- I can refactor anything – I am currently reading the Ruby version of Refactoring (Fowler) and I can see that there are areas where I would be able to apply some of the refactoring methods detailed in the book. I need to be a bit stricter about adhering to the red-green-refactor style, and spending some time thinking about what I could refactor rather than moving onto the next requirement when I get a passing test. 
- I have a methodical approach to solving problems: In light of all of the skills above that I am developing, my approach to problem solving has improved. If I feel stuck on a problem, I tend to write out the issues I am having, and the things I have considering regarding solving them. If I am pairing, I talk to my pair about this, and come up with a list of things to try. 

### **I'm equipped for long term growth**

- I manage my own wellbeing: This is the big one! After having a very challenging time in February and having to defer through ill health, I have taken a very different approach to the course this time. Although I would like to be able to put in long hours coding on the computer each day, I know that this is likely to have an adverse effect on my health. I have been making sure I get plenty of sleep, and always go outdoors at lunchtime. In the evenings, I have been reading some programming books in my arm chair. I'm still learning, but I am taking care of my health as a priority. I have also been much more successful at comunicating my needs to my peers and coaches. I take a break from the screen once an hour to get up and get away from the computer. This has actually helped me on numerous occasions with my code – a short break has helped me process what I'm doing in the background and seemingly solve the problem quicker. 
- I can learn anything by myself: I have been working in accordance with my goals and choosing my own resources. I have balanced learning by doing with watching some videos on Pluralsight and reading programming texts in my spare time. I have focused on deep learning in the afternoon challenges, and have opted to spend some of my independent learning time continuing with this rather than starting new practicals or workshops. 

### **I help my teams succeed**

- I use an agile product development process: So far, I have been writing user stories and drawing some models. 
- I write code that is easy to change: I have sought coach feedback on my challenges and requested feedback on my use of OOP methods, for example, SRP, encapsulation, etc. This is something that I continue to improve through valuable feedback. I want to improve my refactoring skills so that my code is easy to change. I also plan to be aware of code that would benefit from polymorphism such as duck typing and inheritance and implement this in my code. 
- I can justify the way I work: Through reading textbooks, I am gaining a better programming vocabulary and a deeper understanding of why I do the things I do. I consistently talk with my pair partners about what is best practice and why. 
- I grow collaboratively: I have progressed through the afternoon challenges by working collaboratively with my pair. We have used the driver-navigator style, and helped one another with problems and gaining an understanding.
