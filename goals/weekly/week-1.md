# Week 1
[Makers weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)

## Goals 

### 1. Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods ✅
I attended a TDD workshop, completed some modules on the [Testing Ruby with RSpec course](https://www.udemy.com/course/testing-ruby-with-rspec/), and discussed TDD with my pair partners and peer group. 

#### TDD workshop and dice app

### Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation and SRP ✅

##### Single Responsibility Principle: 

Classes should have responsibility over a single part of a program's functionality. Only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class. A class should only have one reason to change. If the class has more than one responsibility then the responsibilities become coupled. Changes to one may hinder the class meeting its other responsibilities. Reflecting on this, this indicates that I should reconsider my Airport class that I created in my challenge, which comprises a number of responsibilities. 

##### Encapsulation

The wrapping of data and functions into a single unit. Method and variables encased within a capsule – a class.

## End of Unit Reflection

**Pairing** Despite feeling considerable anxiety about pairing in the pre-course, I feel that this week's pairing was successful. like I have already developed my pairing skills. I put some of my teaching skills into practice when trying to help my pair partner, such as asking open questions. 

#### Areas I would like to develop
