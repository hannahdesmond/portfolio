# Week 1
[Makers weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)

## Goals for This Week

### 1. Use all of week 1's skills (test-drive a simple program, pair using drive-navigator style, follow an effective debugging process, describe some basic OO principles)

- I continued to test-drive programs, including the pair Oystercard project and solo Takeaway challenge. 
- I recorded my screen and asked for feedback on my debugging process for the Birthdays practical. 
- I collected feedback from my pair partners throughout the week. I attended a workshop on feedback and was able to provide more detailed feedback to my pair partners.
- After attending a domain modelling workshop, I spent more time on domain modelling this week, and was better able to test-drive my programs. 

### 2. Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
- I did the Secret Diary practical.

### 3. Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
- I attended a mocking workshop.
- I used mocking in the Oystercard challenge to test a 

### 4. Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
- I have discussed basic OO principles with a coach when getting some support with the Secret Diary practical. 

### 5. Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback
- I gave my first code review. In future, I will take more time to understand exactly what the code is doing and focus less on refactoring/syntax.

[Project & Coach Feedback]() **Update README for this and and add EÃ³in's feedback & alex debugging feedback - It looks like you had some success following the steps, and I think with practice you'll find that the steps flow almost automatically. I think you could spend more time on the rubber duck step, and that would naturally lead you to the assumptions you're making and want to test**
